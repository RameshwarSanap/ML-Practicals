 Practical 1: Simple Linear Regression
 Aim: To implement Simple Linear Regression using Machine Learning and predict Weight based on Height.

📊 Dataset Used
Height vs Weight Dataset
Input Feature (Independent Variable): Height (cm)
Target Variable (Dependent Variable): Weight (kg)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python
Google Colab
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

🔍 Steps Performed

Imported required Python libraries
Loaded the dataset using Pandas
Separated input (X) and output (y) variables
Split the data into training and testing sets
Trained the Linear Regression model
Predicted values on test data
Evaluated the model using:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Visualized results using a regression line graph

📈 Output
Successfully trained Linear Regression model
Obtained prediction values
Evaluated error metrics
Visualized actual vs predicted values

🧠 Conclusion

Simple Linear Regression was successfully implemented.
The model predicts weight based on height with minimal error, showing a positive linear relationship between height and weight.
