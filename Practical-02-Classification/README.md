# Practical No. 02: Classification Models

## Aim
To implement and evaluate classification algorithms such as
k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM),
and Decision Tree using Python.

---

## Dataset
Iris Dataset from `sklearn.datasets`

- Features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width
- Classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

---

## Algorithms Used
1. k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Decision Tree Classifier

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

---

## Steps Performed
1. Imported required libraries
2. Loaded the Iris dataset
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Trained KNN, SVM, and Decision Tree models
5. Evaluated models using accuracy score
6. Visualized decision boundaries

---

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix

---

## Result
All three classifiers performed well on the Iris dataset.
Decision boundaries help understand how models separate classes.

---

## Conclusion
Classification algorithms can effectively predict class labels.
Visualization helps in understanding model behavior.

---

## Output
Graphs and decision boundary plots are generated using Matplotlib.
